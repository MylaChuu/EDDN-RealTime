## EDDN RealTime Feed

### Live Events from the [Elite Dangerous Data Network](https://github.com/EDCD/EDDN)

Travel journals, discovery logs and market information transmitted by players
into a central data feed to update [star maps](https://edsm.net/),
[prices](https://inara.cz/elite/commodities-list/),
[route plotters](https://spansh.co.uk/plotter) and more.

This is a live monitoring board for that data.

This is a modified version to help with specific faction operations
